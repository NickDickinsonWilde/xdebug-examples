# Basic PHP configuration

# Introduction
For a basic PHP configuration use the `99-debug.ini` either a a standalone file in for example
`/etc/php/8.1/cli/conf.d` (Ubuntu standard 8.1 config path) or into your custom php.ini.

See also [WSL Docker/Lando instructions](../lando-tooling/wsl-docker/README.md).

Additionally, you will need to set a couple environment variables - I suggest EXPORT in your
`.bashrc` or equivalent.
